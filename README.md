# <div align='center'> Using Scientific Literature to Classify Mutations in Tumors </div>

## Introduction

Cancer, genetics, and data have are topics that have fascinated me my entrie life. Cancer develops when mutations in DNA cause cells to grow and divide out of control. This is particularly likely when mutations happen in two different kinds of genes. The first is proto-oncogenes. These genes are generally involved in cell growth and division. When they get mutated they can cause cells to continusously grow and divide beyond the point at which our body needs it. The other kind of gene in which mutations are particularly likely to cause cancer are in tumor-suppresor genes. As the name implies, when they are functional, they actively prevent the formation of cancerous tumors. They work by regulating our how rapidly and often cells grow and divide. When it's time to stop cell division, tumor-supressor genes kick in and stop that process. Proto-oncogenes and tumor supressor genes are both vital to our grwoth and development as humans, but because of the roles they play in our biology, we are particularly vunerable to cancer when they sustain mutations.

In order to understand this project and the mutation classes, a little more background is required.
