# <div align='center'> Using Scientific Literature to Classify Mutations in Tumors </div>

## Introduction

Cancer, genetics, and data have are topics that have fascinated me my entrie life. Cancer develops when mutations in DNA cause cells to grow and divide out of control. This is particularly likely when mutations happen in two different kinds of genes. The first is proto-oncogenes. These genes are generally involved in cell growth and division. When they get mutated they can cause cells to continusously grow and divide beyond the point at which our body needs it.
